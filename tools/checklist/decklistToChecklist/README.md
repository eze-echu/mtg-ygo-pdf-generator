# Decklist To Checklist

# What is this?
This tool was made to create excel spreadsheets from decks with the purpose of tracking expected cards vs received cards.
It creates a single spreadsheet combining all input decks no matter the deck type.

# Usage

* Run ChecklistGenerator.py  
* Follow the instructions in the console  

## WARININGS
Modifing the spreadsheet in any other way than using the dropdowns may render it useless for turning it into a missing decklist with the Checklist To Decklist

## TODO
* Move the fetching of YGO card names to the YGO service
* Remove hardcoded colors and columns in the styles adjustment of the sheets
